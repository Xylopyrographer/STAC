# STAC Release Notes
## v2.0

__New Features__

* _Configurable Polling Interval_
  
  * The amount of time, in milliseconds, between polls of the Smart Tally Server can now be set when configuring the STAC.

__Internal Improvements__

  * The STAC ID is now used as the WiFi hostname, making each STAC uniquely identifiable in the attached devices table of the WiFi router.

  * The WiFi authentication/encryption mode of the STAC when it is being provisioned is now WAP2-PSK (AES).

  *  When operating in busy networks, the "Big Purple X" won't flicker, only activating when there is a number of consecutive communications errors with the Smart Tally Server.

  * Added a "Big Orange X" display error when the STAC cannot connect to the Smart Tally Server. Helps with troubleshooting to distinguish between "Big Purple X" and "Purple Question Mark" type errors.

  * Revised the format of the information dump sent to the serial port on startup.
  
  * A bunch of house cleaning and other tweaks to speed things up and what not. You know, the usual stuff developers do when realizing they shouldn't have done something a certain way to begin with.
  
  * Now based on arduino-esp32 core v2.0.3 or greater.
 
  * A new "_Detailed Release Notes_" document intended for developers is in the `STAC/Code` folder.


## v1.10

__New Features__

* _Adds Peripheral Mode_
    * Allows one STAC to be connected to another via their GROVE ports. The STAC configured in Peripheral Mode operates as if in Talent Mode but it receives its tally information from the connected STAC without the need to establish a WiFi connection to the Roland device. More in the *STAC User's Guide* and the *Peripheral Mode Application Note*.

* _Adds Configuration Check_
    * Previously, the configuration of the STAC would be reset with each software update. After updating to version 1.10 you will have to reconfigure the STAC but from then on new software updates will do a check to see if the existing configuration is compatible with that version. If so, the existing configuration information will be retained. Too cool ðŸ¤¯.
 


## v1.9.1

__Fixes__

Fixes the display glitches during polling of the Smart Tally server.

## v1.9

__New Feature__

* Adds Auto Rotate
    * On startup the STAC determines which way is up and sets the display orientation accordingly. More in the User's Guide.

__Talent Mode__

* When in Talent Mode and WiFi is lost after initial connection on power up or restart, the display switches to the Preview state and remains there until resuming normal operation after the WiFi connection is re-established.


__Information Screen__

* Revised the format of the information dump sent to the serial port on startup.

__Internal Improvements__

* WiFi connection time is much quicker.
* Changes to improve robustness and recovery time if errors occur when communicating with the Smart Tally server.



## v1.8

__New Feature__

* Adds Autostart Mode.
    * On startup when autostart is set, if no button press is seen for about 10 seconds, the STAC will jump right to the WiFi connect sequence and then start displaying the tally status of the active channel.
More in the User's Guide.

__Fixes__

* When configuring the STAC via a web browser, the SSID and password fields now accept spaces as given instead of converting them to '+' characters.

## v1.7.1.1

Minor bug fix release.

No changes to the STAC code.

Only change is to the modified Preferences.cpp file in the `/libraries/Preferences/ `folder.

It was revised to correct a coding error in writing to the `log_e` file in 
the `clear()` and `end()` methods.

This bug would only show in a very very rare case should a commit to the NVS memory fail when calling one of those methods.

If you did not replace the standard `Preferences.cpp` file with the modified one, there is nothing you need to do. The version running in your STAC is all good.

If you did replace the standard `Preferences.cpp` file, follow the directions in the `libraries/libraries_README.md` file using this revised `Preferences.cpp` file. Then re-upload the STAC code into your ATOM and you're good to go.

My apologies. Nothing like writing code to keep one humble.


## v1.7.1
- improve the ST server poll response time by about a gazillion. As a result...
- ...the ST\_POLL\_INTERVAL now does indeed govern the time between ST server polls
- add an information dump to the serial port on startup

## v1.7
- add support for user configurable ST Server port #.
    - Allows STAC to be used in an emulated environment; as in a [Tally Arbiter](http://www.tallyarbiter.com) client

## v1.6
- first public release
