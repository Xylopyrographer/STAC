# Version 1.7.1. README

Minor bug fix release.

No changes to the STAC code.

Only change is to the modified Preferences.cpp file in the `/libraries/Preferences/ `folder.

It was revised to correct a coding error in writing to the `log_e` file in 
the `clear()` and `end()` methods.

This bug would only show in a very very rare case should a commit to the NVS memory fail when calling one of those methods.

If you did not replace the standard `Preferences.cpp` file with the modified one, there is nothing you need to do. The version running in your STAC is all good.

If you did replace the standard `Preferences.cpp` file, follow the directions in the `libraries/libraries_README.md` file using this revised `Preferences.cpp` file. Then re-upload the STAC code into your ATOM and you're good to go.

My apologies. Nothing like writing code to keep one humble.
