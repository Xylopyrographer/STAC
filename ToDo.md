# To Do
1. Turn around time. It'd be nice to speed up the time from when a status request is sent to the Roland switch to when it appears on the display of the STAC.
2. As ths is my first ever sketch, I'm certain there is a better way to implement the polling to the Roland switch. Especially in dealing with the client connect routine.
